### This is a javascript library that manipulates dates and retrieves dates for you. It can also format dates.

#### Simple things like showing the day, month, year can be shown. It can also show hours, minutes, and seconds in various formats

#### All of these functions manipulate the date in some way related to the function title and all have very simple usage. Hopefully before long I will have them all working and available to download through NPM. I could not get the Github linked to the NPM. Confusing documentation is giving me problems understanding.
